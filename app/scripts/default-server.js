// Default Shutterbug server that is used by JS library.
module.exports = "//snapshot.concord.org/shutterbug";
// Note that when you work on the server-side features, you can change this
// path to localhost and all the demo pages will automatically use your local
// server, as they don't specify server explicitly. Just uncomment this line:
// module.exports = "//localhost:9292/shutterbug";
